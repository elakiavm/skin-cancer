# Mole Classifier using CNN | Skin Cancer Detection

This project implements a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** from scratch to classify dermoscopic images of skin moles into **benign** or **malignant**. It serves as a baseline model before comparing more advanced architectures like VGG16, DenseNet201, and Xception.

â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ ...
â”œâ”€â”€ malignant/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ image1.jpg
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ ...
```

## Notebook Overview: `try-with-CNN.ipynb`

| Step | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Step 1: Import Libraries** | Essential Python libraries for deep learning, image processing, and visualization are imported. |
| **Step 2: Enhance Image (CLAHE)** | Implements image enhancement using **CLAHE (Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization)** for better lesion visibility. |
| **Step 3: Load Dataset** | Loads images from `benign/` and `malignant/` folders, resizes them to 224Ã—224 RGB, applies CLAHE, and stores them in memory. |
| **Step 4: Preprocessing & Normalization** | Applies dataset normalization using mean and standard deviation. Labels are encoded and one-hot encoded for classification. |
| **Step 5: Model Architecture (CNN)** | Builds a basic CNN with:
  - Three Conv2D + MaxPooling layers
  - Fully connected Dense layer
  - Dropout regularization
  - Softmax output layer for binary classification |
| **Step 6: Data Augmentation** | Uses `ImageDataGenerator` to introduce variation in training data and reduce overfitting. |
| **Step 7: Model Training** | Trains the CNN on augmented data for several epochs and plots accuracy/loss graphs. |
| **Step 8: Evaluation** | Calculates:
  - Test accuracy
  - Confusion Matrix
  - Classification Report (Precision, Recall, F1-score) |

---

## Results

The model achieves approximately **68%â€“75% accuracy** depending on the batch size and augmentation parameters. Validation curves are plotted for monitoring.

| Metric        | Value (Example)     |
|---------------|---------------------|
| **Test Accuracy** | ~0.72               |
| **Loss**          | Decreasing steadily |
| **Observation**   | Overfitting starts after ~5 epochs, can be mitigated with dropout or data size increase |

## Conclusion

- A custom CNN can already offer **decent classification performance** on dermoscopy images.
- **CLAHE preprocessing** improves contrast and skin feature visibility.
- The model sets a **baseline** for comparing more complex architectures like VGG16, DenseNet201, and Xception.
- Fine-tuning, hyperparameter tuning, or deeper architectures can further improve accuracy.
